# Fresh Finder
## Inspiration
Many people want locally grown food but many farmers markets schedules and vendors change regularly. By aggregating all the farmers markets into one convenient interactive map, we can connect people to locally grown fresh food. This helps the local economy and the local vendors from throwing away fresh food. And it’s a great place for someone new in the city to meet the community.

## What it does
It plots given data and shows relevant information for farmers markets in your area

## How I built it
It was built using a Flask framework with a Python backend. We used a javascript frontend to process geoJson data and display into the google maps API.

## Challenges we ran into
It was extremely difficult to find the right data. Also, half way through the mini-hackathon, we had to pivot our project model away from social media due to the limitations of the available API’s.

## Accomplishments that I’m proud of
It works!

We have a functioning proof of concept that we can build on. :smiley:

## What I learned
API limitations can severely restrict project outcomes and the importance of scoping a project appropriately to the timeframe.

## What’s next for Fresh Finder
We hope to get a better dataset. Add filtering of the data so users can look specific vendors, types of vendors, and food type.
